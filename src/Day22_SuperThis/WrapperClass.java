	 * The wrapper class in Java provides the mechanism to convert primitive data type into object and object into primitive.
	 * 
Autoboxing:-	
The automatic conversion of primitive data type into its corresponding wrapper class is known as autoboxing, for example, -ArrayList
byte to Byte, char to Character, int to Integer, long to Long, float to Float, boolean to Boolean, double to Double, and short to Short.

 * Unboxing	:-
 * The automatic conversion of wrapper type into its corresponding primitive type is known as unboxing. 
 * It is the reverse process of autoboxing	-->>Refer javatpoint for concepts
